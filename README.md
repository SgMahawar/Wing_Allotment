# Wing_Allotment
This is a data structure course project.
Wing Allotment using maximum bipartite matching concept/'Hungarian Algorithm'.
Wing allotment occurs at the end of each year. during this procedure, many students feel dissatisfied since they do not receive their preferred wing.
This project aims to implement a system of allocating wings in such a way that the happy faces are maximised.
